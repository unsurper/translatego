In terrestrial environments,
gravity places special demands on the cardiovascular systems of animals.
Gravitational pressure can cause blood to pool in the lower regions of the body,
making it difficult to circulate blood to critical organs such as the brain.
Terrestrial snakes, in particular,
exhibit adaptations that aid in circulating blood against the force of gravity.
The problem confronting terrestrial snakes is best illustrated by what happens to sea snakes when removed from their supportive medium.
Because the vertical pressure gradients within the blood vessels are counteracted by similar pressure gradients in the surrounding water,
the distribution of blood throughout the body of sea snakes remains about the same regardless of their orientation in space,
provided they remain in the ocean.
When removed from the water and tilted at various angles with the head up,
however, blood pressure at their midpoint drops significantly, and at brain level falls to zero.
